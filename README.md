# express-portfolio

This project is a portfolio that displays previous projects that I have built. What makes this project/portfolio different is that it runs on mainly server side JavaScript as opposed to client side JavaScript. This portfolio is built using the express framework and using the pug template engine to render visible content to the client.

Style Changes: All additional style changes have been added to the bottom of style.css. The first addition is that the project thumbnails were given box shadows to give them a really unique 3d effect. The second style added was the project titles on the home page, they were given an external font from google fonts. The third style added was an animation, when you hover over the project thumbnail, it scales in size to add give more life to the page. The last style added was on the project pages themselves, the project photos were given a box-shadow again for a unique experience and thery were given a stronger border to make the box-shadow look more natural
